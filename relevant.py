"""
Attached to this email is a data set, ds_test_final.csv. The data set includes the following pieces of information:
• Column 1: Observed dependent variable
• Column 2: Fitted Residuals
• Column 3: Fitted Values
• The remainder of the columns: Predictors (not all predictor variables used in the model included in the model are included in the included data set).

To the best of your ability with the data from the file, please carry out the following tasks in Python (using whatever packages and tools you feel are the most appropriate to fully answer the following questions:
1. Load and summarize the included data.
2. Determine a reasonable measure of model quality, and use the included data to compute and report this statistic.
3. Do you consider it a good model? Why or why not?
4. Examine the columns of predictor variables. Note any predictors that should be transformed, dropped or interacted to improve the model.
Include ALL work as a python script. Explanations and answers to direct questions should be included as comments in the script.

## Question 1
#
#   `df.describe()` output, pasted below, provides statistics about the data table.
#   Notable data characteristics are described here.
#   The table has 6 columns (4 indicator or predictor or "feature" variables) 
#   There are no null or NaN values in the table
#   V6 
#      An integer value (but is processed here as a float) between 10005 and 7322564, inclusive. 
#      The quartiles and histograms for V6 (and V76) indicate that it may be log-normally distributed (many more low values that large values in the fat tail)
#   V76
#       Integer value between 1 and 4, inclusive. 
#       It may be log-normally distributed however the order from most frequent to less frequent is: 3,2,4,1 
#       The counts in V76 are: [(1, 7), (2, 811), (3, 1368), (4, 29)] or {3: 1368, 2: 811, 4: 29, 1: 7} 
#       So this is may be a categorical rather than ordinal value
#   Fitted Values: are in the range 888.28 +/- 232.82 (1-sigma)
#       The histogram shows mild assymetry in the distribution of fitted values.
#   Fitted Residuals: 0.0237 +/- 569.9 1-sigma
#       The histogram shows significant assymetry, so the model features should be transformed

## Question 2

# A simple, common measure of model quality is the mean and std of the error
#  (where individual error values are computed as a fraction of the individual predicted value)
err_pct = 100 * df.Fitted_residuals / df.Fitted_Values
err_pct.mean()
# -1.5897469803931876
err_pct.std()
# 71.725621302816833

# Other statistics sometimes used
df.Fitted_residuals.std() / df.Fitted_Values.std()
# 2.4477465236730169
#  It is often also normalized by 
df.Fitted_residuals.std() / df.Fitted_Values.mean()
# 0.64158435507137113

# Sometimes the correlation (normalized covariance) between the fitted value and the residuals can indicate an additional oportunity to produce a better fit
# but this correlation matrix doesn't seem to indicate that, because the cross correlation value is low
df[df.columns[:2]].corr()
#                   Fitted_residuals  Fitted_Values
# Fitted_residuals          1.000000      -0.000159
# Fitted_Values            -0.000159       1.000000


########################################
## Question 3

# The prediction error was -1.6% +/ 71.7% 1-sigma
# Mean error of -1.6% is small, so the center of mass of the predicted value is near the true value
# However 71.7% error std is large and indicates that individual predictions have large error


########################################
## Question 4

# There are large correlations between V23, V34, and V76 (see df.corr() below):
# V23 and V34: 76% 
# V23 and V76: -33%
# V76 and V34: -42%

# So these 3 variables are likely linear related
#
# However V76 appears to be categorical rather than ordinal. 
# Categorical variables can be decomposed into binary values to produce a more accurate model
